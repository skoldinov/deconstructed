# Deconstructed

These are implementations of basic ML algorithms using [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) and (a slightly modified version of) [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) for optimization. (Thanks Andrej!) 

The code of the models is developed to be explainable and understandable. That's it. These are not intended to be efficient or used productively.

Currently implemented: 
- K-Means clustering
- K-nearest Neighbors
- Linear regression
- Logistic regression
- Word2Vec
